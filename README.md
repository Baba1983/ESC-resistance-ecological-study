# ESC-resistance-ecological-study
This research aims to add to the literature investigating AMR dynamics within and across surveillance programs, the objectives of this study were to determine the period prevalence and trend of ESC resistance in E. coli and Salmonella enterica from the selected national surveillance programs from 2003 to 2019 and to compare ESC resistance in E. coli and Salmonella enterica between the selected national surveillance programs over the study period. In addition, we explore the linear relationship between ESC resistance in the enteric bacteria and ESC antimicrobial consumption data reported from each country and to describe the genotypic pattern of ESC resistance in selective ESC-resistant E. coli reported from each country over the study period.
